# Flask-Leaflet-ChartJS
This demonstration was inspired by a Python Flask and ChartJS tutorial hosted on pythonspot.com titled "Flask and great looking charts using Chart.js". What I added was the Leaflet map and MySQL integration so that the data array used for rendering the charts and map inside the HTML CANVAS and DIV area comes directly from MySQL tables instead of Pyphon list/dictionary.
